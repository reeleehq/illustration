"""Shared image fetching — used by the rerank and curation layers.

Both the precision reranker (:mod:`illustration.reranking`) and the Layer-2
classical-CV prefilters (:mod:`illustration.inspection`) need to pull image
bytes off the network and decode them. That logic lives here so there is one
fetch path (one User-Agent, one timeout policy, one fail-soft contract) rather
than a copy per consumer.

Everything here lazily imports ``requests`` / ``Pillow`` so ``import
illustration`` stays dependency-light; the heavy bits ride the optional
``[rerank]`` / ``[curate]`` extras.

>>> # offline doctest: a candidate with no fetchable URL yields None, never raises
>>> from illustration.schema import ImageResult
>>> image_for_result(ImageResult(provider="p", id="1", url="")) is None
True
>>> local_image("/no/such/file.png") is None  # the on-disk path, same contract
True
