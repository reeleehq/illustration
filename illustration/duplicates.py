"""Group images that are the same **subject**, and keep the best one of each group.

The failure this exists for: a search for "Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton" returns
five different files — a colour painting, three nineteenth-century engravings
after it, and a library's re-scan of one of the engravings. Five distinct ids,
five distinct byte-streams, five distinct pixel layouts. To a viewer they are
*the same picture of the same woman*, and a film that uses four of them looks
like it ran out of pictures. Exactly that shipped in a real episode.

``sequence`` already suppresses near-duplicates with a DCT perceptual hash, and
that is the right tool for a different job: pHash catches a re-encode, a rescale,
a re-crop — images that are the same *raster*. It does not catch two engravings
made by different hands after the same sitting, because those genuinely differ
pixel by pixel. Telling those apart needs a model that has learned what a picture
is *of*.

Three signature tiers, strongest first
--------------------------------------

===================== ==================================== ==================
signature             what it recognises                   cost
===================== ==================================== ==================
:func:`dinov2_signature`  same subject / instance, across   ``[dedupe]``
                      medium, crop, palette, engraving      (torch)
:func:`siglip_signature`  same subject, a little looser —   ``[rerank]``
                      reuses the reranker's cached          (already paid if
                      image embeddings                      you rerank)
:func:`phash_signature`   same raster only                  numpy + Pillow
===================== ==================================== ==================

:func:`default_signature` picks the strongest *automatic* one whose dependencies
are actually installed — DINOv2, else pHash — so the behaviour degrades rather
than breaking. Only the first two are ``subject_level``; a caller that needs the
real thing can check :attr:`Signature.subject_level` and say so rather than
silently getting less. SigLIP is opt-in by name: it needs the same wheels as
DINOv2 and is weaker here, so it is worth asking for only when the reranker has
already paid for its embeddings — and it reads network URLs only.

Self-supervised descriptors beat text-aligned ones here — DINOv2 is trained to
be invariant to crop and perturbation and is consistently better at fine-grained
instance retrieval than CLIP-family encoders, which are optimised to match
*captions* and therefore pull "any portrait of a woman in period dress" close
together. That is why DINOv2 is the preferred tier and SigLIP only a fallback
for a caller who already has its vectors.

One similarity measure
----------------------

Every signature produces an L2-normalised vector and everything is compared by
**cosine**, including the perceptual hash — its bits become ±1, for which cosine
is an exact affine image of Hamming distance (``cos = 1 - 2·d/bits``). So one
threshold semantic covers all three tiers, and each :class:`Signature` carries
the threshold that is right for *it* rather than leaving the caller to guess.

Search results or files on disk
------------------------------

The same question gets asked of a folder — "here are 200 stills, which of them
are the same picture?" — so the path pair mirrors the result pair exactly, and
the only difference is where the pixels are read from. That difference is a
parameter, not a code path: :func:`local_signature` points the chosen tier's
loader at the file instead of at a URL, so a local dedupe touches no network.

Usage::

    from illustration.duplicates import dedupe, group_duplicates
    from illustration.duplicates import dedupe_paths, group_duplicate_paths

    keep = dedupe(results)                  # best of each group, order preserved
    groups = group_duplicates(results)      # or inspect the grouping yourself

    keep = dedupe_paths(folder.glob("*.jpg"))       # -> the surviving Paths

    Returns :class:`~pathlib.Path` objects, not :class:`ImageResult` wrappers —
    a caller who handed in paths wants paths back, and the wrapper carries no
    information the file does not.
