"""Licence-code normalisation — one vocabulary for four provider vocabularies.

Every provider spells the same licence differently: Openverse emits ``by-sa``,
Wikimedia Commons emits ``cc-by-sa-4.0`` (and ``CC BY-SA 4.0`` as the short
name), Pixabay emits ``Pixabay License``. :func:`normalize_license` folds those
spellings onto one canonical code so the licence gate
(:func:`illustration.schema.license_allowlist`) can compare like with like,
instead of silently returning ``[]`` for two of the four built-in sources.

**The safety invariant, and it is the whole reason this module is small and
boring: normalisation may never drop a restriction token.** ``nc``
(non-commercial) and ``nd`` (no-derivatives) are exactly what an allowlist
exists to exclude, so the transform only ever removes things that carry no
permission meaning — a ``cc``/``cc-`` prefix and a trailing version number —
and every other spelling must be listed, by hand, in :data:`LICENSE_ALIASES`.
A code that is not recognised stays as-is and therefore fails the allowlist:
**unknown is not allowed**, in both directions.

>>> normalize_license("cc-by-sa-4.0")
'by-sa'
>>> normalize_license("CC BY-SA 4.0")
'by-sa'
>>> normalize_license("Pixabay License")
'pixabay-license'
>>> normalize_license("cc-by-nc-nd-4.0")          # restrictions survive intact
'by-nc-nd'
>>> normalize_license(None) is None
True

:func:`display_license` is the inverse-flavoured sibling, for *showing* a
licence rather than comparing it — see its own docstring for why it works on
the recorded spelling rather than the normalised code.
