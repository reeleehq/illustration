"""Persist curation/selection decisions as ``lacing`` standoff annotations (R2 §6).

Per R2 §6, a director's curation decisions should be **standoff annotations**, not
destructive edits: a beat → its chosen image, layered so a human override is a
*new* annotation that supersedes (never overwrites) the machine's choice, with
full provenance. The ecosystem already has exactly this — ``lacing`` (the
standoff annotation system: typed ``Annotation`` envelope, W3C PROV-O provenance,
append-only, OTIO export). This module is the thin adapter that maps an
illustration :class:`~illustration.sequence.SequenceResult` onto lacing — it does
**not** reinvent an annotation store.

A stored selection carries the **rights record** — ``license``, ``license_url``,
``attribution``, ``source_page_url``, ``author``, ``author_url``, ``cacheable``
(:data:`illustration.schema.RIGHTS_FIELDS`) — alongside the candidate's identity,
under the same field names :class:`~illustration.schema.ImageResult` uses. The
annotation is the durable artifact; a URL alone stops being able to answer "may
we ship this, and whom must we credit?" the moment the link rots or the
aggregator re-tags the file, and that is the one field set no later step can
reconstruct.

One deliberate modeling choice: a "best image for beat *i*" selection is a *graph*
relation (beat → candidate), not inherently time-keyed — but ``lacing`` is
interval-keyed, and at selection time the storyboard has no rendered timeline
yet. So selections are keyed on an **ordinal beat-index timeline**
(``RationalTime(i, rate=1)`` = "beat *i*"), which is honest (a storyboard *is* an
ordered sequence) and lets the real render timeline stay a separate concern. If a
general "selection track" facade proves worth sharing, it belongs upstream in
``lacing``; this stays a domain-specific adapter.

Behind the optional ``[persist]`` extra (``lacing``); imported lazily so base
``illustration`` never requires it.
