"""The normalized result schema — the single source of truth (Pydantic v2).

:class:`ImageResult` is the stable contract that every provider normalizes into
and that the (future) agentic curation layer consumes. License, attribution,
``source_page_url`` and ``cacheable`` are first-class and populated from day one,
because licensing/cacheability is a primary concern for commercial-adjacent
video (see ``misc/docs/design/illustration_design.md`` §3).

>>> r = ImageResult(provider="openverse", id="abc", url="https://x/img.jpg",
...                  license="by-sa", cacheable=True)
>>> r.provider, r.cacheable, r.tags
('openverse', True, [])
>>> r.model_dump()["license"]
'by-sa'

The ``raw`` field carries the untranslated provider payload (the escape-hatch
"nothing is lost" convention), so a downstream consumer can always reach a
provider-specific field the normalized schema doesn't name.

    this is the companion audit for the *human-readable* ``attribution``
    string a credit roll actually renders. CC BY / CC BY-SA require the
    licence to be identified in the credit — a licensed result with a
    populated, correct ``license`` can still carry an ``attribution`` that is
    just an author's name (illustration#22, seen on ~4% of one Wikimedia
    session's hits), which silently breaches that condition if a consumer
    renders ``attribution`` verbatim, as the package's own guide tells them
    to. This never rewrites or drops a result — it is read-only, for a
    pipeline to review, log, or compose a fallback credit from ``author`` /
    ``license`` / ``license_url`` for exactly the results it returns.

    What counts as "naming the licence" depends on the licence. For the
    CC BY family (``by``, ``by-sa``, ``by-nc``, ...) the attribution must name
    *that* licence (see :func:`illustration.licensing.licenses_named`), or
    contain the result's ``license_url``: "© Jane Doe", "Public domain", or a
    different CC code (e.g. "CC BY" for a ``by-nc`` image, which drops the NC
    restriction) are all flagged. For any other licence, the looser
    :func:`illustration.licensing.mentions_license` signal is used.

    A result with no ``license`` at all is not flagged: there is nothing to
    name, and it should already have been dropped by ``license_allowlist`` if
    that matters to the caller.
